# The following must be created *before* instantiating a GCSv4 container. 
# Create a new file with the contents:
#   GLOBUS_USER=<username>
#   GLOBUS_PASSWORD=<password>
# And then create the credential with:
#   slate secret create <secret-name> --group <group> --cluster <cluster> \
#    --from-env-file <filename>
GlobusCredentialSecret: globus-creds # maps to <secret-name> as in the above

# The following file must contain usernames and encrypted passwords for any 
# users who may log in to the system. This user will be used to generate a
# MyProxy certificate for the end user who will transfer files.
# The file must follow passwd(5) format, with one user per line with an 
# encrypted password in the second field:
#   slateci:ENCRYPTEDPASSWORDHERE:1001:1001:SLATE CI:/home/slateci:/bin/bash
# Once this file has been created, store it as a SLATE secret with:
#   slate secret create <secret-name> --group <group> --cluster <cluster> \
#     --from-file <filename>
GlobusPasswdSecret: globus-passwd # maps to <secret-name> as in the above
